# House of Cards Web Application!

Welcome to our web application: House of Cards. This project was made at the completion of phase 2, at Flatirons School by Brooke Ross and Christopher Dennis. After only 3 weeks of experience with React this project is filled with concepts that are fundamental to running a React app. 

## House of Cards Functionality

Prior to running this app on your local device, you will need to download axios and react-router-dom:

### `npm i axios --save`

### `npm i react-router-dom`

react-router-dom, must be version 5 to run! You can change this by going into your package.json and editing it to "^5"

After downloading the above you will need to run your application and your db.json server. You can do so by setting them up on two separate localhosts:

### `json-server -p 4000 db.json`

In a second terminal run the following to start your application:

### `npm start`


## More About our App?

After 3 weeks of studying React, you will find multiple React elements used in this application! Navigate between three worlds by clicking on their franchise' iconic cards! Add, sort, and search through your collections as you build the biggest card collection that mankind has ever seen (or as much as our db.json server can hold)! Your additions will persist and upload to our db.json server so make sure that you add your information carefully!
